# The future of the web will need a different sort of software developer 

https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-future-of-the-web-will-need-a-different-sort-of-software-developer/

I found this article interesting because it shows how the role of the Software Developer is constantly changing as the technology world changes. It says how automation tools for programming, such as low-code or code suggestion tools are constantly improving, which means that software developers will need to spend less time coding. This does not mean the demand for software developers will decrease, but means that the skills required for the future software engineer will be different than the current skills required. This will allow for people in different backgrounds (outside of coding) to enter more easily into the software engineer market. Furthermore, I found it interesting how the article suggests there will be a stronger focus towards AI and IoT developers, since the internet will use these technologies to become even more integrated.

### Comment

Thank you for the interesting article and accompanying breakdown. I often hear about the rapid "democratization" of coding via no-code tools and automation posing a threat to the livelihoods of software developers. The proliferation of these tools will only serve to augment the capabilities of existing developers, who will now have to spend less time on manual/repetitive tasks and more on problem-solving and collaboration, and lower the barriers of entry into the industry for those who do not necessarily possess a technical background. The point about IoT raises an interesting question on the nature of the security of these increasingly interconnected systems. Being cognizant of cyberthreats and the knowledge on how to leverage emerging technologies like advanced encryption techniques is something that will likely become a valuable skill for future software engineers in the AI/IoT space.
